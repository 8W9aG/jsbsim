  Function: Models an F-16A Block-32 (Basic US configuration)

  Source: Richard Murray's F16 Model page, NASA TP-1538 wind tunnel data. (Dec. 1979)

          "Observers Aircraft" by William Green, 1987 Edition (ISBN 0-7232-3458-2)
          ACM 3.0 configuration files (very unreliable, but it gives a head start)
          General Dynamics F-16 Dash-1 (basic drag and weight data only)

  Todo: 
        Better spring and damping factors for the gear?

  History: 
  1.00	Initial revision.
  1.01	Figured CXq, CYr, CYp, CZq, Clr, Clp, Cmq, CNr and Cnp
        were all in one table. Split them up.
        More accurate placement of CG and its relations (gear, tanks etc).
        Correct AC_CHORD which turned out to be CBAR (in feet)
  1.02	Add comments to the appropriate tables.
        Add General Metrics data at the end of the file.
        Add horizontal tail, vertical tail and engine data.
        Fixed gear Y location.
        Fixed a typo in the DLDA table.
  1.03  Fixed a typo in the Cmde table.
        Minor engine location updates.
        Added some extra metrics data at the end of the file.
  1.04  Updated the source of the information.
        Turned out XML doesn't allow "--" inside comments, changed that.
        Better location of CG, Tanks, Pilot eyepoint and Gear (still not exact).
        Updated fuel capacity to Dash-1 data.
  1.1   Added CZ, Roll due to elevator deflection table.
        Updated CG-X location to match Richard Murray's data.
        Added AC_LV and AC_HTAILARM.
        Reference point is now at the tail of the aircraft.
        Changed CBAR which was incorrect because of a feet to meter
        misunderstanding.
  1.2   Changed static and dynamic friction coefficients for Main landing gear.
        Removed unknow values for S, B, G, HE and Rtod. They ware already in place.
        Added left and right wingtips and ventral fins, vertical tail tip and nose.
        Moved CG-Z location to 0.0, centre of chord of main wing.
        Updated TODO to reflect the current state.
        Moved nozzle to new location.
  1.3   I got aa hold on a detailed F-16 metrics scheme, updated CG, RP and it's relatives.
        Complete reorganization of tables. I *think* they are in the proper place now.
        Added CZq (Lift_due_to_pitch_rate) and CXq (Drag_due_to_pitch_rate).
        Added air intake location as a fixed point.
  1.4   Minor changes (e.g. The location of the EYEPT wasn't relative to CG).
        Changed |BETA| to use FG_ABETA (Thanks to Tony Peden).
  1.5   Changes by Jon Berndt to prefent parser errors.
          Comments are not allowed within coefficients.
  1.6   Extra metrics data at the end of the file.
	Changed alpha from degrees to radians.
        Fixed a typo for inlet X-location.
        Added pilot pointmass.
  1.7	Split file up into ChangeLog, README and f16.xml.
        Updated all tables to confirm to the NASA TP-1538 document.
