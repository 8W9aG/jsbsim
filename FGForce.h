 HISTORY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5/20/00  TP   Created


FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this class is to provide storage for computed forces and
encapsulate all the functionality associated with transforming those
forces from their native coord system to the body system.  This includes
computing the moments due to the difference between the point of application
and the cg.

CAVEAT:  if the custom transform is used for wind-to-body transforms then the
         user *must* always pass this class the negative of beta. This is true
         because sideslip angle does not follow the right hand rule i.e. it is
         positive for aircraft nose left sideslip.  Note that use of the custom
         transform for this purpose shouldn't be necessary as it is already
         provided by SetTransform(tWindBody) and is not subject to the same
         restriction.
