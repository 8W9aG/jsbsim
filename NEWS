Aeromatic

The JSBSim aircraft configuration files can be a little confusing for beginners
- especially for those who are not terribly familiar with aircraft dynamics and
control. In an effort at easing the process of creating an aircraft flight model
to use with JSBSim and FlightGear (www.flightgear.org), David Culp has created a
clever web application called Aeromatic. With a few quick clicks of the mouse, a
usable boilerplate model can be created. For maximum accuracy, the file can be
further edited after examination, and as more refined data is acquired. The code
for Aeromatic is managed as part of the JSBSim project (www.jsbsim.org). To try
it out, go to the JSBSim home page and select the Aeromatic link in the left
panel.


New documentation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have added a new document to the JSBSim web site that deals with automatic
flight and flight controls using JSBSim. It is a work in progress (aren't they
all?). Please send any comments/criticisms/praise to jon@jsbsim.org

In the press

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FlightGear (featuring JSBSim, YASim, and UIUC-LarcSim) is comparitively reviewed
against MSFS and X-Plane (say that fast and it sounds like "explain") in the
April 2003 issue of EAA's magazine, "Sport Aviation". JSBSim is mentioned
explicitly a couple of times. The article was quite positive.


New JSBSim Release
jberndt - 2003-01-21 05:06   -   JSBSim Flight Dynamics Model
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JSBSim 0.9.4 has been released in the form of a source gzipped tarball. It
includes the new FCS switch and deadband components. See the release notes. It
also includes a capability where a takeoff report is generated similar to the
landing report.


FCS Deadband control added

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Deadband control has been "fleshed out" and is now functional. Complete
testing is pending.


FCS Switches added
jberndt - 2003-01-09 05:43   -   JSBSim Flight Dynamics Model
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JSBSim now supports configurable switches in the flight control system. This
allows switches - either panel on/off or conditional rotary switches - to be
defined in the configuration file. The definition uses properties to define the
conditions.


Versatile "Property System" implemented fully in JSBSim
jberndt - 2002-09-22 15:42   -   JSBSim Flight Dynamics Model
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony has added a new feature to JSBSim, the ability to create variables (via the
property tree) in the config file. These variables can be created and assigned
values in the FCS (flight control system) then referenced anywhere else in the
config file (such as in a coefficient). Every flight control system is unique,
and we wanted to avoid having hard coded support for every permutation. The
property tree gives us the opportunity to support almost any configuration
without hard-coding.
