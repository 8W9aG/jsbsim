This directory contains the DirectSearch library functions needed to support
the trim analysis capability added by Agostino De Marco. This library is
needed and included by the FGTrimAnalysis and FGTrimAnalysisControl classes
located in the src/initialization/ directory.

Also, the following definitions must be made in the Makefile or IDE before
compiling this code:

OLD_LIBC AGO_DIRECTSEARCH

Also, to suppress extraneous warnings, this command line option can be supplied

-Wno-non-template-friend
