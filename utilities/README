SimPlot can be built using these files. It is also required,
however, that you have DISLIN installed. You can get DISLIN
at the web site: http://www.linmpi.mpg.de/dislin. Follow the
directions for installation for the platform you have. Once
DISLIN is properly installed there is one additional action
that must be taken on the developer's part. The SimPlot code
makes use of the Standard Template Library (STL). The vector
object defined in the STL conflicts with an object by the
same name in DISLIN. However, the DISLIN vector is not used
by SimPlot. So, you must go into the dislin_d.h file (the double
precision version of dislin.h) and comment out the vector
declaration.

SimPlot can be built under Linux with this command line:

g++ *.cpp -I /usr/local/dislin/ -ldislin -o simplot

Under CygWin, (Unix on Windows: http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin)
use the following line:

g++ -o simplot datafile.cpp main.cpp -I/usr/local/dislin
              -L/usr/local/dislin -ldisgcc -lgdi32 -lcomdlg32

this should give you the simplot program.

To run SimPlot, enter the data filename as the only argument, for
example:

./simplot JSBout.csv

Additionally, a plotfile can be specified as the second argument,
for example:

./simplot JSBout.csv plotfile

The plotfile is  a series of directives for simplot to read. The
program creates the specified set of plots in .png format, and provides
an .html page to interface with the images. The name of the file
is JSBSimPlots.html.

The plotfile is specified like this:

<title>
<X axis title>
<Y axis title>
<scaling: auto or minX|minY|maxX|maxY>
<X axis variable name[s]>
<Y axis variable name[s], separate by | if more than one>
...

Example:

Ground Track
Longitude (rad)
Latitude (rad)
auto
Longitude
Latitude
Body Rates
Time (sec)
P, Q, R (rad/sec)
50.0|-0.6|100.0|0.6
Time
P|Q|R
...
