SimPlot can be built using these files. It is also required,
however, that you have DISLIN installed. You can get DISLIN
at the web site: http://www.linmpi.mpg.de/dislin. Follow the
directions for installation for the platform you have. Once
DISLIN is properly installed there is one additional action
that must be taken on the developer's part. The SimPlot code
makes use of the Standard Template Library (STL). The vector
object defined in the STL conflicts with an object by the
same name in DISLIN. Howecer, the DISLIN vector is not used
by SimPlot. So, you must go into the dislin.h file and
comment out the vector declaration.

SimPlot can be built under Linux with this command line:

g++ *.cpp -I /usr/local/dislin/ -ldislin -o simplot

Under CygWin, (Unix on Windows: http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin)
use the following line:

g++ -o simplot datafile.cpp main.cpp -I/usr/local/dislin
              -L/usr/local/dislin -ldisgcc -lgdi32 -lcomdlg32

this should give you the simplot program.

To run SimPlot, enter the data filename as the only argument:

./simplot JSBout.csv

Then, follow the directions as displayed.
