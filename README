1) Introduction
---------------

JSBSim is a multi-platform, general purpose object-oriented Flight
Dynamics Model (FDM) written in C++. Jon Berndt and Tony Peden began
about mid-1998 writing JSBSim. As of this writing it is the default
FDM for FlightGear. JSBSim can also be run in a standalone batch mode
for testing and study. More information on JSBSim can be found at the
JSBSim home page here:

http://jsbsim.sourceforge.net

The standalone version of JSBSim can be easily built from the command
line of a unix or unix-like (CygWin/Linux/Unix/IRIX, etc.) system like
this:

make -fMakefile.solo

If you are on an IRIX machine you can use the Makefile.irix makefile.
Directions are also provided below for using traditional auto* utilities
also provided with JSBSim.


2) Building with autoconf/automake
----------------------------------

Unpack the distribution tarball (if needed - CVS users will have
downloaded the code directly) using your preferred method, and change
to the working directory. For example :

$ tar xvfz JSBSim-0.1.2.tar.gz
$ cd JSBSim-0.1.2

NOTE for CVS users: If you are using JSBSim from a CVS checkout, or
snapshot, you will need to create the initial configure script. The
commands to do this have been included in the 'autogen.sh' script, so
just :

$ ./autogen.sh

If you wish to customise your version of JSBSim, use the following to
determine any build-time options you may be interested in.

$ ./configure --help

Then :

$ ./configure

This will check your system platform, compiler and other local
configuration variables needed to build JSBSim, and generates the
necessary Makefiles. Next :

$ make

Will compile the various classes, and link the library. Finally :

$ make install

Unless specified otherwise (with --prefix configure option), this will
install 'JSBSim.a' into '/usr/local/lib'.
